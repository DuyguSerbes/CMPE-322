# Ticket Reservation System Simulation
## Overview
In this project, theater ticket reservation system simulation is implemented.  This program  will  be  run  as  multi-threaded  by  considering  synchronization  and  data  consistencyissues.   The  scenario  of  the  simulation  is  that  the  clients  arrive  at  the  ticket  office  for  seatreservation and tellers reserve the seats for them.

## Implementation
make file is created to run as executable.
```
make
./simulation.o configuration_path output_path
```
