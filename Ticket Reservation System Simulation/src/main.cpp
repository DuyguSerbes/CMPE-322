/*
*This program provides a possible solution for teather ticket reservation system.
 *
 * Author: Duygu Serbes
 *
 * Name: CMPE 322 Project 2 - Sync-Ticket.
 *
 * This programs have three teller, named as A, B, and C. A has priority on B and C to take care of clients.
 * B has priority on C.
 *
 * The system has 3 theater information, which are OdaTÄ±yatrosu, UskudarStudyoSahne, KucukSahne.
 * Each of them has different capacity but the all system can deal with maximum 300 client at the same time.
 *
 * The desired and number of client given by user input file. The file also includes data of each client dor example
 * arrival time, waiting time, and requested seat.
 *
 * The client have to sleep in the amount of arrival time after it created
 * from main. The arrived clients are put on queue and tellers deals with them according to their priority order and availability
 * status. While teller making booking and prepare its ticket in the amount of waiting time, client shouldn't leave from
 * the system and wait until ticket is ready.
 *
 * Also, booking is made according to client's desired seat but if it is not available.
 * Teller is looking for empty seat with the smallest integer number. If no seat is found as available, client cannot take seat.
 * But still have to wait.
 *
 * How to compile: gcc main.cpp -o main.o -lpthread
 * How to run: ./main.o input_path output_path
